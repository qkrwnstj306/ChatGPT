      "A network topology refers to the physical layout of a network, including how devices on the network are connected to each other and how data is transmitted between them. It defines the way in which nodes and links are arranged in a network. There are several types of network topologies such as star topology, ring topology, mesh topology, bus topology, and so on. \n",

      "For example, the Star Topology is a common type of network topology used in computer networking. In this topology, all devices on the network are connected to a central hub or switch using individual cables. All data transmitted between nodes on the network passes through the hub, which serves as a central connection point. This design makes it easy to add or remove devices from the network without disrupting other nodes, and it helps isolate faults or problems on one device from affecting the rest of the network.\n",
